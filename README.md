In Completion of the Project Proposal in Principle of Programming Language.

#*
This plan is a proposal for a new free-field program code based on the strong, proven base of C and Java. 
It aims to combine this robust foundation with current syntactical conveniences to improve the readability and ease the development.
The essence of the language is constructed on the conventional C-style principles. Identifiers are case-sensitive and are named in the traditional C fashion. 
The language also uses the standard arithmetic, logical, and relational operators of C, with a familiar precedence order and short-circuit evaluation.
Nevertheless, the language changes this C-like base by adding a special set of keywords, like what if and do then, the keywords that are more expressive. 
It also has a different syntax used to comment, single-line comments are denoted by ##, and block comments are denoted by #*...*##, a difference to its predecessors. 
As opposed to C, which uses compact operators such as the braces and the slash extensively, this language is more readable, with more descriptive keywords and a special syntax of comments. 
This combination is to make a language as accurate as C, but more modern and readable.
This design is explained by the fact that more readable code is more maintainable and with a softer learning curve. 
The language seeks to limit typical syntax errors and minimize the cognitive load used by the developer by substituting dense symbols with descriptive words, 
and is therefore a suitable language to use in education and any other complex project where clarity is mandatory.
